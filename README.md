# The_FeedBack_App

The provided HTML and JavaScript code represents a web page that allows users to give feedback publicly. The page consists of a form where users can enter their feedback, which is then displayed in a feedback list below the form. The feedback items in the list include the company name, a badge letter representing the company, the feedback text, the number of upvotes, and the number of days ago the feedback was submitted.

Description:

The HTML code defines the structure and layout of the web page. It includes elements such as the page title, header, form, feedback list, and a list of predefined hashtags. The JavaScript code adds functionality to the web page and handles user interactions.

The JavaScript code starts by defining global variables and constants for various DOM elements and values used in the code. These elements include the textarea for feedback input, a character counter element, the form element, the feedback list element, the submit button element, and a spinner element.

The code then defines a function called renderFeedbackItem, which takes a feedback item as input and generates HTML code to display the feedback in the feedback list. This function is later used to display user-submitted feedback and the feedback retrieved from an API.

Next, there is an input handler function (inputHandler) that updates the character counter element to show the number of characters remaining as the user types in the textarea.

The code also defines a submit handler function (submitHandler) that is triggered when the user submits the feedback form. This function prevents the default form submission behavior, validates the input text, extracts additional information from the text (such as the company name and badge letter), creates a feedback item object, and then calls the renderFeedbackItem function to display the feedback in the feedback list. If the input text is invalid, a visual indicator is shown to the user.

After that, the code fetches feedback data from an API endpoint using the fetch function. Once the data is retrieved, the spinner is removed, and the feedback items are iterated over using a forEach loop. For each feedback item, the renderFeedbackItem function is called to display it in the feedback list.

If there is an error retrieving the feedback data, an error message is displayed in the feedback list.

Overall, the code allows users to enter feedback, validates the input, displays the feedback in a list, and retrieves feedback data from an API to populate the list.
